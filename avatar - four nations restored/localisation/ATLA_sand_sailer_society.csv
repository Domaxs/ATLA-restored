sand_sailer_racers_desc;To navigate the near endless desert, the sandbenders use §YSand Sailers§! to move along the sand. A few years ago a couple of young sandbenders thought it would be a great idea to start a sand sailer racing club, now various races are held amongst the sandbender tribes for awards and bragging rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sand_sailer_racers_leader_desc;The current leader of the Sand Sailer Racers is the Race Overseer. They organize races and championships, handle rank ups and keep everyone in the club in check.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.40;Let's race.;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.50;I won't commit to this just yet.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.300;[Root.GetFirstName], we would be honored to have you join the Sand Sailer Racers. However, to join you must win a exhibition race against another new racer.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1010;[Root.GetFirstName], you and I know as well as anyone else in the club that practice makes perfect. You should hit the dunes sometime and improve your skills. Not saying you're a bad sailor or anything... Practice makes perfect though, right?;
EVTDESC_SANDR_1013;Dear [Root.GetFirstName], congratulations on completing your personal training. I hope the past few months have been very benefical to you.; 
EVTOPT_SANDR_1013;And benefical it was...;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1020;You climb aboard your trusty sand sailer and venture into the great Si Wong Desert. Beforehand, you planned out all the exercises and routines you will do, now all that needs to be done is proper execution of said exercises and routines.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1020;Let's get to work.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1022;It has been a few exhausting weeks since you began your practice session. While speeding along the desert on your sand sailer, working on your turns and stops and speed ups under the hot sun you decide to practice a maneuver. §RWhich maneuver do you select?§!;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1022;Hairpin Turn.;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1022;Overspeed.;
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1022;I should stick to the basics.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1023;I want to be the best sailor there ever was!;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1023;Simply being a competent sailor will suffice for me.;
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1023;What was I thinking about agai-ZzZzZzZzZzZ;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1024;Your several month long practice session is soon coming to a close, and you decide one final grueling exercise is required. Most sand sailors go half the distance up the Si Wong Trail as a final exercise to their training sessions, but a bold few take the Old Si Wong Trail, a much longer and winding trail.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1024;I will take the Old Si Wong Trail!;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1024;No need to kill myself out here.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1025;You executed that maneuver perfectly! With success like this, who could possibly stand in your way?;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1025;My practice to be the best continues.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1027;I'm sorry to hear about your injury while training, I wish you a speedy recovery [Root.GetFirstName].;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1027;I should be more careful next time...;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1050;After it is all said and done, you feel much improved in your bending and racing abilites. The decisions you made during your training session paid off.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1050;I feel much more stronger and healthy.;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1050;I feel as if my bending has improved!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1051;After it is all said and done, you feel that you have improved in your bending and racing abilites. You feel as if you could've went a little harder but nonetheless, you are a better sand sailor than you once were.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1051;I need to rest.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1052;After it is all said and done, you feel as if you have fell short in your practice. You don't see yourself as a worse sailor compaired to when you started your session, but you don't feel improved.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1052;Not all is lost, as this still was a learning experience.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1023;You are sitting next to a small fire that you created deep in the Si Wong Desert. You are about halfway through your sand sailer practice. Night falls and you begin doze off, ready for sleep, but not before one final thought crosses your mind.;

# RESULT.POOR;Poor Result;
HARD_MANUVER;Attempt a harder manuever, with a chance to either get hurt and fail the quest or gain §Y100§! prestige.;

sand_quest_race_training_desc;It is imperative that a sand sailor becomes attuned with his or her sand sailer and masters vital maneuvers.;
